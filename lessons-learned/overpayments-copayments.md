# Lessons Learned 
## Product: Mobile Overpayments and Copayments (Debt Services/Financial Management Team)

This tracks lessons learned from working on features for other teams so that we can continuously improve our process. Everyone from both teams is welcome to contribute to this document.

## Product/Delivery
- We need to track decisions in a decision log on the product brief
- We want to have a kickoff meeting with the right people in the room (at minimum: VA PO, product, UX, tech lead)
- We should compile a general list of questions from Research/Design, Engineering, and Product necessary for each discipline to start work on the initiative, or surface any potential blockers. These questions can be discussed at the kickoff meeting or completed by the team we are working with before the kickoff meeting.
