# MFS Team Definition of ready

* (Limited) scope has been defined and agreed upon
* All resources needed are available to our team
  * API/systems needed are available in production and can handle the additional load
  * Background research/design (by feature team) is up to date/reflects web feature
  * Content for the feature is finalized (except for mobile-specific changes)
  * Metrics/monitoring have been identified and documented
  * Product/regulatory requirements are clearly documented
  * Any related deadlines are clearly documented
  * Test users are identified and documented
  * Contacts for each area of expertise (engineering, product, UX) are identified and available to consult throughout the process
* There is no parallel work on web feature (even content!) that will potentially impact scope of mobile feature, or any changes can safely be held for next mobile version
* The work has been vetted and is feature work, not infrastructure work (which should be owned by the core mobile team)
* NOTE: The feature team is responsible for the Collab Cycle; MFS is responsible for mobile touchpoints.
