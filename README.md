# VA Mobile Feature Support (MFS)

The VA: Health and Benefits mobile application gives Veterans the ability to manage their health care, benefits, and payments from their mobile phone or tablet. This app is accessible to Veterans on Apple and Android devices. The focus of the Mobile Feature Support team is to develop new features that will improve the VA: Health and Benefits mobile application and support the team’s mission to continuously deliver high-quality digital experiences for the benefit of all Veterans and their families. 

The process of adding a new feature to the mobile app begins with collaboration from the VA.gov product team to better understand how to solve the user's needs. After aligning on the problem to be solved, our team will conduct user research to verify that the feature will meet the user's needs, create designs that align with user research, and finally implement a solution that will provide Veterans with a beneficial user experience. Please connect with our team on OCTO Slack channel #mobile-feature-support-public if your team manages a product not included on the mobile app.  

## Aligned to 2025 OCTO OKRs

MFS actively contributes toward the following 2025 OCTO OKRs:

- **Objective 1: VA’s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.**

## List of Products

Our team has contributed to the following products to date:

#### Currently in progress
 
- [Veteran Status Card Redesign Web](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/veteran-status/v2-IIR/new-home-and-ux-product-outline.md)  |  **Objective 1** - The Veteran Status Card design on VA.gov and the mobile app are not aligned. The Iterate, Innovate, and Run (IIR) team managed the research and designs that would provide Veterans with designs that are the same as VA.gov and mobile. Our team is currently implementing the designs for VA.gov.   
- [Overpayment and Copayment Debts](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/combined_va_debt_portal/mobile/Overpayment%20and%20Copayment%20Debts%20Product%20Brief.md)  |  **Objective 1** - Veterans can experience benefit overpayment debt and medical copayment debt. Currently, the mobile app does not have any debt-related information for Veterans to access. MFS is working closely with the Financial Management team to allow Veterans to view their benefit overpayment and medical copayment debts, as well as information and statements on the mobile app within the Payment section. The team is in the process of developing wireframes and will then conduct usability testing.  

#### Completed Product Contributions

- [Veteran Status Card Redesign Mobile](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/veteran-status/mobile/implementation-of-vsc-redesign.md)  |  **Objective 1** - The Veteran Status Card design on VA.gov and the mobile app are not aligned. The Iterate, Innovate, and Run (IIR) team managed the research and designs that would provide Veterans with designs that are the same as VA.gov and mobile. This was released on May 6, 2025 to the mobile app.  
- [Pre-Need Burial](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/burials-memorials/pre-need/mobile/product/product-brief.md)  |  **Objective 1** - Within the authenticated section of VA.gov, Veterans can learn what pre-need burial is and if they are eligible to be buried in a VA national cemetery, by completing form 40-10007. Eligibility decisions are currently sent via mail or phone, and no digital versions are accessible from Veterans’ accounts. Our team conducted user research to understand if Veterans would like to see status updates on their application, have the decision letter available within their VA.gov account, and be able to share the decision letter with other individuals. The research findings and current technical limitations to implement research recommendations on the mobile app are listed in the Pre-Need Burial Product Brief and the MFS team concluded the research findings on May 5, 2025.   
-[Veteran Status Card Surfacing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/75019932daa028ec5d415031f2891e96cf324397/products/veteran-status/mobile/mobile-product-brief.md)  |  **Objective 1** - The Veteran Status Card provides information about a Veteran's Status and is only accessible to eligible Veterans. Mobile app users do not know the Veteran Status Card exists in the mobile app if they are not eligible. The Iterate, Innovate, and Run (IIR) team managed the research and designs to allow ineligible Veterans to be presented with the Proof of Veteran Status button and understand why they are not eligible for this card. This was released on April 22, 2025 to the mobile app.
